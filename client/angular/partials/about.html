The reader brings to the act of reading his or her cognitive capabilities
(attention, memory, critical analytic ability, inferencing, visualization); motivation
(a purpose for reading, interest in the content, self-efficacy as a reader);
knowledge (vocabulary and topic knowledge, linguistic and discourse knowledge,
knowledge of comprehension strategies); and experiences.

        <p class="info">2. THE TEXT <br>
The features of any given text have a large impact on comprehension. While
reading, the reader constructs various representations of the text that are important
for comprehension. Those representations include the surface code (the
exact wording of the text), the text base (idea units representing the meaning of
the text), and the mental models (the way in which information is processed for
meaning) that are embedded in the text. </p>

        <p class="info">3.) THE ACTIVITY <br>
The reading activity involves one or more purposes or tasks, some operations to
process the text, and the outcomes of performing the activity, all of which occur
within some specific context. The initial purpose for the activity can change as
the reader reads. That is, a reader may encounter information that raises new
questions and makes the original purpose insufficient or irrelevant. Processing
the text involves decoding the text, higher-level linguistic and semantic
processing, and self-monitoring for comprehension</p>

        <p class="info">Sarah E. Scott from the University of Michigan.
Wrote a paper in 2009 called Knowledge for teaching reading comprehension: Mapping the terrain, She explains By situating reading comprehension as a process of extracting and constructing
meaning, the RAND group reminds us that the process of making meaning is not a
passive endeavor. Many texts do not include the totality of information that would be
necessary in order to successfully construct meaning. That is, the reader must make
referential and causal/logical inferences that are not explicitly made in the text. This is
the constructing part of the process (van den Broek, 1994). The process of making
meaning, then, suggests a dance between the information that is available in the text and
the information the reader already knows in order to construct meaning.</p><p>A necessary condition of meaning is the existence of terms or concepts. Thus, a
reader interacting with a text is making meaning from terms or concepts that exist in a
world beyond the text -- this is the extraction part of the process of constructing
meaning. But humans cannot simply extract meaning -- they have to do something with
these extractions. </p>
